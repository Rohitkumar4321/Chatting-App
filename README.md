# Chatting-App
This project is a real-time 1:1 chat application developed using React Native for the frontend and Node.js (Express + Socket.IO) for the backend, with MongoDB as the database. It enables users to register and log in securely using JWT-based authentication, then view a list of all registered users and start private chats with anyone.
